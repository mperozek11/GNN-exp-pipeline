FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\877.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 37
Number of edges: 10
Number of single edges: 10
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

45 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
45000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
45045 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 90090 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0.015 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.017 seconds.
