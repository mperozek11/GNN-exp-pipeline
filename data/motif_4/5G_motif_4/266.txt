FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\5G_ascii\266.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 6
Number of edges: 6
Number of single edges: 6
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

10 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
500 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
510 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 2754 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
