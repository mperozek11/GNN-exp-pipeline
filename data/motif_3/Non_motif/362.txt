FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\362.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 12
Number of edges: 9
Number of single edges: 8
Number of mutual edges: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

28 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
28000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
28028 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 81081 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.024 seconds.
