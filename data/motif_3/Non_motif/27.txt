FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\27.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 9
Number of edges: 6
Number of single edges: 4
Number of mutual edges: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

4 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
4000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
4004 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 33288 tries were made, 11755 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.016 seconds.
