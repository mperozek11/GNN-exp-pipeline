FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\225.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 34
Number of edges: 33
Number of single edges: 32
Number of mutual edges: 1
Number of vertex colors: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   exchanging only edges with the same vertex colors,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

497 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
497000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
497497 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 297297 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0.012 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.248 seconds.
