FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\820.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 37
Number of edges: 4
Number of single edges: 3
Number of mutual edges: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

2 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
2000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
2002 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 22166 tries were made, 8300 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.017 seconds.
