FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\68.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 15
Number of edges: 14
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 14

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

58 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
57998 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
58056 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 111303 tries were made, 11657 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.057 seconds.
