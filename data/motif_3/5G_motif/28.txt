FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\5G_ascii\28.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 6
Number of edges: 10
Number of single edges: 1
Number of mutual edges: 9

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

16 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
16000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
16016 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 90090 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0.008 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.021 seconds.
