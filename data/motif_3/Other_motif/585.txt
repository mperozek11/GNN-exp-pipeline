FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Other_ascii\585.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 43
Number of edges: 18
Number of single edges: 5
Number of mutual edges: 13

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

12 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
12000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
12012 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 63905 tries were made, 53376 were successful.
Randomization took 0.012 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.015 seconds.
