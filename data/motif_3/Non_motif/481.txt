FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\481.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 5
Number of edges: 3
Number of single edges: 3
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
1000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
1001 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 13861 tries were made, 8223 were successful.
Randomization took 0.008 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
