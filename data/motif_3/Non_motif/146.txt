FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\146.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 12
Number of edges: 8
Number of single edges: 5
Number of mutual edges: 3

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

5 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
5000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
5005 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 32011 tries were made, 22907 were successful.
Randomization took 0.008 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
