FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\5G_ascii\220.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 7
Number of edges: 7
Number of single edges: 5
Number of mutual edges: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

15 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
15000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
15015 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 63063 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.015 seconds.
