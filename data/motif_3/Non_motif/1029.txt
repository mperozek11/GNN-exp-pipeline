FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\1029.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 5
Number of edges: 4
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 4

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

4 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
4000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
4004 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 36035 tries were made, 1 were successful.
Randomization took 0.003 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.005 seconds.
