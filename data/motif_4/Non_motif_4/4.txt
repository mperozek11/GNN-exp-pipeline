FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\4.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 11
Number of edges: 6
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 6

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

0 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
0 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
0 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1007 tries were made, 913 were successful.
Randomization took 0.001 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
