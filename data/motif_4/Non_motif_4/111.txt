FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\111.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 35
Number of edges: 6
Number of single edges: 2
Number of mutual edges: 4

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

1 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
50 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
51 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 2754 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
