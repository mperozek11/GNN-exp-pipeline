FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\23.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 15
Number of edges: 11
Number of single edges: 10
Number of mutual edges: 1

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

56 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
2800 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
2856 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 3625 tries were made, 998 were successful.
Randomization took 0.015 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.001 seconds.
