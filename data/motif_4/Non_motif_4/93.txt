FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\Non_ascii\93.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 17
Number of edges: 11
Number of single edges: 6
Number of mutual edges: 5

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 4

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

5 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
224 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
229 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 2399 tries were made, 1556 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
