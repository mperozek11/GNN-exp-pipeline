FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\s_cural\5G_ascii\219.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 39
Number of edges: 3
Number of single edges: 1
Number of mutual edges: 2

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 50 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

3 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
150 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
153 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1377 tries were made, 0 were successful.
Randomization took 0 seconds.
Enumeration took 0 seconds.
